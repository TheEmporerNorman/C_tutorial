# PXT102/202 C Programming Language Workshop
Demonstrators: Zoltan Sztranyovszky and Michael Norman

This guthub repository contains all the material for the "C Programming Language Workshop" workshop.

## 1  What is C?

C is a widely used, general-purpose programming language that is used across many sectors.  It is useful forhigh  performance  scientific  programming  due  to  its  lightweight  and  efficient  nature.   It’s  inbuilt  capabilityto directly access and manipulate memory which allows for low-level control over program functionality andoptimisation.  Unlike interpreted languages like Python (which is a high-level language itself written in C) it requires compilers to produce an optimised machine code executable which can often run orders of magnitudefaster than the equivalent Python code.

Some of the key features of C include:
* Often fast execution speeds
* Direct control over computer resources (eg.  memory management)•High Portability (runs in a multitude of environments)
* Widespread usage (many existing tools and libraries already exist, and documentation and tutorials arewidely available)

## 2  Why should I use it?

Useful for computationally expensive calculations when execution time or memory usage is a bottleneck.3  What will we learn?By the end this session the students will:
* Be  aware  of  the  underlying  infrastructure:   purpose  of  the  source  code,  editor,  compiler,  linker  andexecutable
* Be able to use correct syntax to produce compilable code•Be aware of and able to apply different data types available in C
* Apply flow control (loops and conditional statements)•Be able to write simple functions for better readability and modularity
* Apply memory management (including the use of pointers) in order to work with large data sets•Be able to read in or write out data in a logical format

## 4  What do I need to do next?

In order to come along to session, you need to:
* Windows users:  Visual Studio Community, or Atom (editor) + MinGW (compiler)
* Linux and Mac users have built in software
* Fill in your information via the online sign-up sheet
